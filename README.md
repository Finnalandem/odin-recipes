# Odin-Recipes

Recipes Project for The Odin Project

## The Odin Project

### What I've Learned So Far

So far I have learned the intracacies of Git and all that it has to offer. I have also learned the file structure and layout of a basic HTML/CSS project. Also I have learned to create a boilerplate HTML file. I will continue with the course and keep practicing what I have already learned to strengthen the concepts.

## Update

I have now finished the project and learned a bunch along the way. I even learned a new way to display fractions with `&frac`, solidified my understanding of HTML, and became comfortable with using several HTML elements.

The project features a recipe website that links you to different recipes pages that I have created. I added some slight CSS customization of my own for an extra challenge, as well as using some extra HTML feature I learned along the way.

All in all, I really enjoyed this project and look forward to what's next!
