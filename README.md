### What I've Learned So Far

So far I have learned the intracacies of Git and all that it has to offer. I have also learned the file structure and layout of a basic HTML/CSS project. Also I have learned to create a boilerplate HTML file. I will continue with the course and keep practicing what I have already learned to strengthen the concepts.
